While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the linking of native modules. The error message was vague, and standard troubleshooting steps didn't resolve the issue. The error appeared intermittently and only when deploying to a specific device, not during local development.  The build process would fail with a cryptic error that didn't clearly point to the source of the problem within my code.  I suspected an issue with the way Expo was handling dependencies or native modules, especially considering the intermittent nature of the error.
