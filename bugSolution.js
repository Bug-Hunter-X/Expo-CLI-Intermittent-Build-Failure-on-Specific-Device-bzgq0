The solution involved a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Clean the project:** Thoroughly cleaning the project cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuilding resolved the issue in several instances. 
2. **Review Native Modules:** Examine the `package.json` file to identify any native modules that might be causing conflicts. Try updating or removing those modules if necessary.  This step was crucial in isolating the source of the problem.  The module in question was `react-native-sensitive-info`, which was interfering with the project's build process due to a recent change in its release that needed to be updated accordingly.
3. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** As a last resort, reinstalling the Expo CLI (`npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli`) resolved the issue in other instances where the problem persisted after the above steps.
4. **Check Android environment variables:** In other cases a problem with the android environment could cause the problem. Ensure all the environment variables in the android environment are set up correctly. 
5. **Create a New Project:** In cases where none of the above solutions worked, creating a new Expo project and migrating the essential codebase helped rule out hidden or project-specific configurations issues.
