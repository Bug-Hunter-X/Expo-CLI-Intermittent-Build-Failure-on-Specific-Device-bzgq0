# Expo CLI Intermittent Build Failure

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered while building an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The build process would intermittently fail when deploying to a specific Android device, producing a vague and unhelpful error message.  The issue is not reproducible in local development or on other devices. The root cause appears to be related to native module linking or dependency management within the Expo environment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build and run the project on an Android device (the device where the issue initially occurred). Note that the error may not consistently appear on each build attempt. The error may only appear in a specific environment.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves carefully reviewing native module dependencies, potentially updating them, and thoroughly cleaning the Expo build cache.  In extreme cases, reinstalling the Expo CLI or creating a new project may be necessary.
